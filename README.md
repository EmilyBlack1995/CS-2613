# CS-2613
CS 2613 - Computer Organization - University of Oklahoma

This is a compilation of all of my work from Computer Organization (AKA CS 2613), a course taken at the University of Oklahoma for 
undergraduates majoring in Computer Science. All of my code is original and from me. If you intend to use my code, please provide
appropiate credit to the author (me). Thanks! :)

The goal of this project was to take a number from 0-99 and add up all the odd numbers till you reach n, then output that number.
